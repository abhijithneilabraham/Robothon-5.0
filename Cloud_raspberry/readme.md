I am trying to upload to cloud using a python script and raspberry pi.

1)https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/admin/start

I am also uploading a program to create a csv file if you need to write the data into a csv because you might need to upload as a file instead of values

check trycsv.py




Client id:69063974530-dkukpv1j3crqht8eu70geukrd3lv25td.apps.googleusercontent.com


Client secret:  	VEeR5BKQpi2zKVFY_Cl6prtd



this is for google drive verification



The above stuff should work without asking for authentication every time,but if in case it is not automated,
